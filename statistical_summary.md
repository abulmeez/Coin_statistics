# Statistical Analysis Summary

## 100 Runs Analysis
- Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE): 33.95%
- Fitted Function: y = 0.47 * 2^(1.06*n + -0.72)

## 1000 Runs Analysis
- Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE): 36.24%
- Fitted Function: y = 0.80 * 2^(0.97*n + 0.46)

## Key Findings
1. The theoretical function (2^n) tends to underestimate the actual number of flips required.
2. The fitted functions show that the actual relationship is more complex than the simple theoretical model.
3. The 1000-run analysis provides a more accurate estimate of the true relationship.
